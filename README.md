# WikitionaryJS
An extremely powerful dictionary which uses Wikitionary to look-up words in over 8000 languages.

**Note: WikitionaryJS required jQuery running on the target website.**

## How to use
Enter the command `wikiJS(word, language);` to get a two-dimensional array response. For example, if you looked up `wikiJS('Roman', 'English');`, it would return the following:
`I'm working on it!`
